Hi!

If you are looking for help on how to use dedupe for your own data, please ask on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). For example, if you are trying to adapt an example to use data, get help on StackOverflow

If you use the `python-dedupe` tag on StackOverflow, it will help the right people find your question.

If one of the examples in this repository isn't working on the example data, then please do open an issue on this repository.
